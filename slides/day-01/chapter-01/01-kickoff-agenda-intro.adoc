This workshop has been specifically designed for business professionals without technical backgrounds. You do not need any coding experience or technical AI knowledge to participate effectively.

Basic computer literacy is sufficient for this workshop. If you're comfortable using business applications like Microsoft Office, collaboration tools, or enterprise systems relevant to your role, you'll have the technical foundation needed to generally understand the Integrail AI Studio platform.

What's most valuable is your business knowledge—specifically your understanding of your organization's processes and workflows. Your expertise in how work currently gets done in your department or function will be essential for identifying automation opportunities. This workshop will help you apply that knowledge to discover where AI agents can add the most value.

The ability to identify challenges and inefficiencies in current operations is also important. Participants who can recognize bottlenecks, repetitive tasks, error-prone processes, or areas where employees spend significant time on low-value activities will gain the most from our sessions.

Finally, an open mindset toward innovation and process transformation will enhance your experience. We'll be exploring new approaches to work that may challenge existing assumptions about what tasks require human involvement. Your willingness to reimagine processes—not just automate them as they exist today—will be key to unlocking the full potential of agentic AI.

Remember, this workshop focuses on the business application of AI technology, not its technical implementation. Our goal is to empower you to identify opportunities, design solutions, and plan implementations—all without requiring you to understand the underlying technical complexities.
