=== 1. Be Specific & Explicit About Outcomes

* Rather than assume model will intuit your needs:
  ** Clearly state what you want
  ** Include the response format
  ** Level of detail
  ** Tone (business, casual, formal, customer-facing)
* For example, instead of asking "Tell me about our quarterly results," specify:
  ** _"Analyze our Q2 financial results in a 5-bullet executive summary highlighting year-over-year trends in revenue, expenses, and profit margins."_

Being specific and explicit about desired outcomes is particularly important with probabilistic models. Rather than assuming the model will intuit your needs, clearly state what you want, including the format, level of detail, tone, and any specific elements you require. For example, instead of asking "Tell me about our quarterly results," specify "Analyze our Q2 financial results in a 5-bullet executive summary highlighting year-over-year trends in revenue, expenses, and profit margins."

=== 2. Provide Relevant Context

* Overcomes LLM knowledge limitations
* Remember, probabilistic LLMs don't have access to information beyond their training data 
* Often means including specific facts, figures, or background info
* For example: when asking for analysis of business situation, include key data points the model needs to consider

Providing relevant context helps overcome the knowledge limitations inherent in these models. Remember that probabilistic LLMs don't have access to information beyond their training data unless you provide it. For business applications, this often means including specific facts, figures, or background information in your prompt. For example, when asking for analysis of a business situation, include the key data points the model needs to consider.

=== 3. Few-shot Learning

* Powerful technique for demonstrating expected outputs
* Show LLM one or more examples of type of response you want
  ** Provides pattern LLM can follow
* For example:
  ** If you need product descriptions in a specific format, provide an example:
  ** _"Please write product descriptions for our new line in this format: [Product Name] - [One sentence benefit]. Features include [3 key features]."_

[.notes]
--
Using examples, often called few-shot learning, is a powerful technique for demonstrating expected outputs. By showing the model one or more examples of the type of response you want, you provide a pattern it can follow. This approach is particularly effective for specialized formats or when you need consistency across multiple outputs. For instance, if you need product descriptions in a specific format, provide an example or two in your prompt.

=== 4. Manage Token Limitations

* All LLMs have context windows that limit how much inbound prompting and response text (tokens) they can process at once
* Provide essential information rather than exhaustive details
* For example:
  ** Summarizing background information rather than including complete documents
  ** Linking to reference materials rather than pasting their entire contents

[.notes]
--
Managing token limitations is important since all LLMs have context windows that limit how much text they can process at once. Focus on providing essential information rather than exhaustive details. For business applications, this might mean summarizing background information rather than including complete documents, or linking to reference materials rather than pasting their entire contents.
--

=== 5. Iterative Prompting

* Start broad, then refine based on initial responses
  ** Begin with general request
  ** See model response
  ** Then iterate with more specific guidance based on what's missing or needs improvement 
* Iterative approach often yields better results than crafting perfect prompt on first attempt

[.notes]
--
From a business strategy perspective, an effective approach is to start with broader prompts and then refine based on initial responses. Begin with a general request to see what the model produces, then iterate with more specific guidance based on what's missing or needs improvement. This iterative approach often yields better results than trying to craft the perfect prompt on the first attempt.
--

=== 6. Business-specific Prompting Strategies

* Business-specific prompting strategies might include:
  ** Use industry terminology to improve relevance
  ** Specify intended audience for output (e.g., "Write this for C-level executives")
  ** Include company-specific context that might not be in model's training data
* These help tailor generic LLM capabilities to your specific business needs

[.notes]

Business-specific prompting strategies might include using industry terminology to improve relevance, specifying the intended audience for the output (e.g., "Write this for C-level executives"), and including company-specific context that might not be in the model's training data. These adaptations help tailor generic LLM capabilities to your specific business needs.

This slide summarizes the essential prompting techniques for probabilistic LLMs. Effective prompting starts with clear, specific directives—detailing the desired output format, tone, and level of detail—to guide the model accurately. Including relevant context, such as key business data, helps overcome the inherent knowledge limitations of these models. The use of few-shot learning by showing examples sets the expected output pattern, especially for specialized tasks. 

Managing token limitations is crucial; focus on providing only essential details and consider summarizing larger texts. Iterative prompting involves starting with a broad query and then refining the request based on the initial response to improve relevance and completeness. Incorporating business-specific terminology and context tailors the model's output to your organizational needs. Together, these strategies ensure that you achieve consistent, high-quality responses that align with your business applications.
