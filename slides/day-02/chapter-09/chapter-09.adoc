== TTL Management in CockroachDB

=== Why Row-Level TTL Matters
* Automated data lifecycle management is crucial for modern applications
* Manual cleanup processes are error-prone and resource-intensive
* Regulatory compliance often requires systematic data removal
* TTL provides a reliable, performant solution for data expiration
* Reduces operational overhead and ensures consistent data management

Row-Level TTL is a critical feature for modern database management. It automates
the process of removing expired data, which is essential for maintaining
database performance, ensuring compliance with data retention policies, and
implementing efficient data lifecycle management. Without TTL, organizations
often rely on complex application-level code or manual processes, which can be
unreliable and resource-intensive.

CockroachDB's TTL mechanism ensures that expired data is removed efficiently
without requiring manual intervention, reducing the risk of orphaned or outdated
records. This feature is especially useful in applications dealing with
temporary or compliance-sensitive data, such as session logs, transaction
histories, and time-limited offers.

=== Understanding Row-Level TTL
* TTL automatically removes expired data based on time conditions
* Works at the storage layer for optimal performance
* Supports both absolute timestamps and relative time expressions
* Configurable scheduling with cron-style expressions
* Balances cleanup operations with system performance

[.notes]

Row-Level TTL in CockroachDB operates directly at the *storage layer*,
ensuring high efficiency and minimal impact on query performance. Unlike
application-driven deletions, TTL does not require explicit `DELETE` statements,
as expiration policies are automatically enforced.

TTL can be configured using:

- *Absolute timestamps*: A column that explicitly defines when a row should be deleted.
- *Relative time expressions*: Defines a time-based retention period (e.g., `ttl_expire_after = '30d'`).

CockroachDB leverages *background jobs* to manage TTL cleanup, and these jobs can be fine-tuned using cron-style scheduling (`ttl_job_cron`) to minimize performance impact during peak hours.

=== Implementing TTL
* TTL configuration requires either `ttl_expiration_expression` or `ttl_expire_after`
* Expiration can be based on any timestamp column
* TTL jobs run on a configurable schedule using cron syntax
* Supports both `timestamp` and `timestamptz` data types
* Can be modified or paused without table restructuring

[.notes]
--
When implementing TTL, you must specify either `ttl_expiration_expression` or
`ttl_expire_after`. The `ttl_expiration_expression` can reference any timestamp
column in the table. The default schedule for TTL jobs is *daily* (`@daily`),
but it can be customized using cron syntax.

*Example*: Defining TTL Based on an Expiration Column

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
) WITH (
    ttl_expiration_expression = 'expires_at',
    ttl_job_cron = '@hourly'
);
----

In this example:

- The `expires_at` column defines when each session expires.
- The TTL job runs *every hour* (`@hourly`), ensuring timely cleanup.

TTL configurations can be modified dynamically:
[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_expire_after = '7d');
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_job_cron = '0 3 * * *'); -- Run cleanup daily at 3 AM UTC
----

Pausing TTL jobs is also supported:
[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_pause = 'on');
----

This allows administrators to temporarily disable TTL cleanup without altering table schema.

=== TTL Management and Monitoring
* TTL jobs can be monitored through the DB Console
* Status and metrics available via system tables
* Supports pause/resume functionality for maintenance
* Configurable batch sizes for performance tuning
* Integration with CockroachDB's job framework

[.notes]
--
Monitoring TTL execution is crucial to ensure that cleanup processes do not
interfere with production workloads. CockroachDB provides multiple tools for
observing TTL jobs:

*Monitoring TTL Jobs*

1. *DB Console*: 

   - The CockroachDB Web UI displays active TTL jobs, their status, and execution history.
   
2. *Querying System Tables*:
   - View TTL jobs using:
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE job_type = 'ROW LEVEL TTL';
```
+

   - Check TTL schedules:
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM [SHOW SCHEDULES] WHERE schedule_name LIKE '%TTL%';
```

*Managing TTL Jobs*

- *Pause TTL Cleanup*:
+
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_pause = 'on');
```
+

- *Resume TTL Cleanup*:
+
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_pause = 'off');
```
+

- *Modify TTL Execution Schedule*:
+
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_job_cron = '@daily');
```
+

This level of control allows for precise tuning of TTL operations, ensuring that
they run during optimal time windows and avoid impacting transactional
workloads.

=== Best Practices and Considerations
* Monitor TTL job performance impact
* Consider scheduling during off-peak hours
* Index design affects TTL cleanup performance
* Batch size tuning may be necessary for large tables
* Test TTL configuration in non-production first

*Key Best Practices for TTL Management*

1. *Monitor the Impact on Performance*
   - TTL jobs can generate a high volume of deletions, which may trigger additional write amplification due to MVCC garbage collection.
   - Monitor job execution time and resource utilization via:
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE job_type = 'ROW LEVEL TTL';
```
+

2. *Schedule TTL Cleanup During Off-Peak Hours*
   - By default, TTL jobs run daily (`@daily`), but modifying this to *off-peak hours* minimizes the impact on active transactions:
+
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_job_cron = '0 2 * * *'); -- Run at 2 AM UTC
```
+

3. *Optimize Indexing for TTL Queries*

   - TTL deletions involve scans, so having an appropriate *index strategy* reduces unnecessary table scans.
   - Ensure that *the expiration column is indexed* when TTL is configured based on `ttl_expiration_expression`:
+
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON user_sessions (expires_at);
```
+

4. *Batch Size Tuning for Large Tables*

   - The default batch size for TTL deletions may not be optimal for large datasets. Adjust this using:
+
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_sessions SET (ttl_batch_size = 5000);
```
+

5. *Test TTL Configurations in a Staging Environment*

   - Before enabling TTL in production, verify behavior in a controlled environment.
   - Use CockroachDB's *EXPLAIN ANALYZE* feature to observe execution plans before applying TTL policies.

Following these best practices ensures that TTL jobs execute efficiently without negatively impacting database performance.
